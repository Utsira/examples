# Code examples

All files are designed to be run in Codea, a Lua-based development environment for the iPad. Each file contains multiple Codea tabs in a single file. To add them to Codea, copy the entire file contents to the clipboard (it may be easier to do this from the raw page). In Codea, long press the *Add New Project* button, and select *Paste Into Project*.
